TripleTen Sprint 3: Statistical Data Analysis

This data analysis project is based on data from a telecom operator company, Megaline. Megaline offers two distinct plans: Surf and Ultimate. Surf being the cheaper package at 20 USD monthly while the Ultimate plan costs 70 USD. Ultimate offers a significant increase in calling, texting and internet limits. The goal of this project is to analyze the behaviors of the customers to determine which plan brings Megaline more revenue so that they can adjust the advertising budget to focus more on the plan that brings in more revenue.

This analysis of Megaline's Surf and Ultimate plans provides valuable insights into customer behavior, revenue generation, and regional differences. After cleaning and preparing the data, we calculated monthly revenue per user. Examining call usage, we found that users of both plans exhibit similar calling behavior, with mean call durations nearly identical. For messaging and internet usage, Ultimate plan users benefit from generous limits, leading to fewer overage charges compared to Surf users. Despite this, revenue from Surf users is increased by these overage charges, which often elevate their monthly fees close to those of Ultimate plan users. Nevertheless, the Ultimate plan consistently brings in higher revenue per user, with an average of 72.31 USD versus 59.99 USD for Surf.

Hypothesis testing confirmed significant differences in revenue between the plans and between users in the New York-Newark-Jersey City area and other regions. The Ultimate plan yields more consistent revenue due to its higher monthly fee, while the Surf planâ€™s revenue is more variable, largely dependent on additional charges. While overage charges from Surf users contribute to revenue, the Ultimate plan is the more consistent and profitable option. Thus, focusing marketing efforts on the Ultimate plan may maximize long-term revenue for Megaline.
